## Wahoo Yippee Look at me Learnin

I've wanted to learn HTML and CSS for a long time now and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be introduced now. This is my first assignment for my Web Typography class at UMass Dartmouth, and it has been much more educaational than I originally thought it would be. This personal site project has allowed me to confront the things I want as a designer, and how I want to present myself in this industry. I've given myself an identity, curated all my favorite elements of design and tossed them together in such a great exercise. This has been the perfect opportunity for learning HTML and CSS, and I get this amazing starter website as the fruits of my labor. I'm excited to see where it'll go, and how much I can improve it in the coming weeks, months, or years.

If anyone is curious, the mockups for this page were designed using Figma. Fonts found on Google Fonts (everybody say thankyou Google) Coded using GitHub and VS Code. The background image was sourced from the Pexels database and edited using Adobe Photoshop. My knowledge of how to build this was sourced from Lara Henderson, and the willpower came from some source unknown to man.
